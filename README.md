## 📥 How to Download and Use  

Follow these steps to **download and run the notebooks locally**:  

### 🔹 **Step 1: Clone the Repository**  

Open a terminal and run:  

```bash
git clone https://github.com/SudharsaaX/AI19642-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting.git

```

Alternatively, you can **download the ZIP file** from GitHub:  

1. Click on the **"Code"** button (green button at the top).  
2. Select **"Download ZIP"** and extract it.  

### 🔹 **Step 2: Navigate to the Directory**  

After cloning or extracting, move into the folder:  

```bash
cd AI19642-Time-Series-Analysis-and-Forecasting
```

### 🔹 **Step 3: Install Dependencies**  

If a `requirements.txt` file is available, install dependencies using:  

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

(If `requirements.txt` is unavailable, manually install required libraries based on the imports in the notebooks.)  

### 🔹 **Step 4: Open the Notebooks**
